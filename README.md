# Introduction
This is a straightforward lock mechanism that can be integrated into a smartphone without needing any third-party apps.

Simply input the IP address of your device (e.g., your phone) into the code. Then, whenever your device moves out of the network, your PC, laptop, or system will automatically lock itself.

## Testing
This was a fun project created in under 10 minutes to demonstrate the concept. It has been developed and tested on Kali Linux.
